== Description ==

Socialphotos integrates your customer generated content from Socialmedia on your website. Increases Brand Credibility and Drives sales.

You simply connect your Instagram account, create hashtags and connect them with your created galleries.

There are 2 types of galleries - Product (NOT AVAILABLE IN WP YET) and a Unique Gallery. Product galleries have one look for all products (each gallery has a #product_name_hashtag), whereas Unique galleries ca be customised as you want and placed wherever you want on the site.

Afterwards spread the word to tag photos with #your_hashtags. Each hashtag has its own photos. Then you can moderate the stream and choose which photos to display.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Socialmedia platform can be connected to the widget?

 For now it's Instagram. Later we plan on adding Twitter and other platforms. 

= I created hashtags but nothing is displaying on the site. Why?

 Each hashtag when created has a checkbox to connect it with a gallery. If you forgot to do it when creating the hashtag,
 you still can connect it by going to 'Hashtag stream' and choosing the hashtag you need. Under the hashtag you'll see in how many
 galleries it's used. (Ex. http://bit.ly/1Da4ubI). If 0, then press 'Change' and check the galleries you need. (Ex. http://bit.ly/1c0mo6M)

= Why my tagged photos do not show up in the Hashtag stream?
	
 Instagram allows to collect photos only from public accounts. If the users account who tagged photos with your hashtag is a “Private Account”, those photos will not show up in your “Hashtag stream”

First of all, check if your account is public and try to tag a photo. Go to your Instagram account Settings > Private Account. If your photo shows up but other user photos don’t, then all works perfect and their accounts are private. Don’t worry, 90% users accounts are public anyway.

= How many galleries I can make?

There are no limits on how many galleries you can make and no hashtag limits. However, there shouldn’t be more than 2 galleries on 1 page.

There are 2 types of galleries:

1) Galleries - used for different purposes and each gallery has it’s own customisation. They can be put anywhere on your website.Galleries - used for different purposes and each gallery has it’s own customisation. They can be put anywhere on your website.

2) Product galleries - (WE DO NOT YET HAVE A PRODUCT SYNCHRONISATION POSSIBILITY IN WP, HOWEVER, WE ARE WORKING ON IT) Single customisation for all galleries, unique product hashtags
 

= Can I create hashtags in other languages besides english?
	
 Currently you can make hashtags in any language except those which consist of hieroglyphs such as traditional Chinese

= I moved from Shopify / SEOshop to Wordpress / WooCommerce. How can I migrate my data from Socialphotos?

 If you had only unique galleries then the migration is easy. Just install the plugin and paste the generated gallery HTML code into the plugins input field or any place on your website if you want to use the gallery in a more freestyle way e.g. on a separate page.

 If, however, you had product galleries, you can’t migrate them because no product retrieving is possible yet. :( The workaround is to create a gallery for each product and connect hashtags. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Showcase of the products gallery. (Product has a unique hashtag. The photo feed contains only product related photos.
2. Modal window showcase when a user clicks on an image in the photo feed. Image with its details and pagination. 
3. Gallery showcase. Usually put on the homepage or on a separate page e.g. Customer photos or Reviews. Text above grid is free to be customised as well as the gallery itself.
4. Another gallery showcase. 6x3 photo grid. Each gallery has its own connected hashtags which can be seen in the text.

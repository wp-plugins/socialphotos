== Description ==

 Socialphotos integrates your customer generated content from Socialmedia on your website. Increases Brand Credibility and Drives sales.
 You simply connect your Instagram account, create hashtags and connect them with your created galleries.
 There are 2 types of galleries - Product and Custom. Product galleries have one look for all products
 (each gallery has a #product_name_hashtag), whereas Custom galleries ca be customised as you want and placed wherever you want on the site.

 Afterwards spread the word to tag photos with #your_hashtags. Each hashtag has its own photos. Then you can moderate
 the stream and choose which photos to display.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Socialmedia platform can be connected to the widget?

 For now it's Instagram. Later we plan on adding Twitter and other platforms. 

= I created hashtags but nothing is displaying on the site. Why?

 Each hashtag when created has a checkbox to connect it with a gallery. If you forgot to do it when creating the hashtag,
 you still can connect it by going to 'Hashtag stream' and choosing the hashtag you need. Under the hashtag you'll see in how many
 galleries it's used. (Ex. http://take.ms/p79C2). If 0, then press 'Change' and check the galleries you need. (Ex. http://take.ms/FI6IQ)

= Why my tagged photos do not show up in the Hashtag stream?
	
 Instagram allows to collect photos only from public accounts. If the users account who tagged photos with your hashtag is a “Private Account”, those photos will not show up in your “Hashtag stream”

First of all, check if your account is public and try to tag a photo. Go to your Instagram account Settings > Private Account. If your photo shows up but other user photos don’t, then all works perfect and their accounts are private. Don’t worry, 90% users accounts are public anyway.

= How many galleries I can make?

You have the ability to create 2 types of galleries: 
 1) Product galleries - Single customisation for all galleries, unique product hashtags
 2) Custom galleries - Galleries for different purposes and each gallery has it’s own customisation. They can be put anywhere on your website.

There are no limits on how many galleries you can make and no hashtag limits. However, there shouldn’t be more than 2 galleries on 1 page.

= Can I create hashtags in other languages besides english?
	
 Currently you can make hashtags in any language except those which consist of hieroglyphs such as traditional Chinese
